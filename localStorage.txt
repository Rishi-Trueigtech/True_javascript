JavaScript localStorage is a web storage feature that allows you to store key-value pairs in a browser. 
Data persists even after the browser is closed, providing a method to save and retrieve data across sessions, 
enhancing user experience by maintaining state and preferences.

localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, 
sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.
